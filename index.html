                                    structure from
                                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                                    enroll by a former
                                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                                    curriculum and staff
                                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                                    assistance. The agile team
                                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                                    way that no tutorial
                                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
                                    of my developent
                                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                                    receiving multiple offers.
                                    100% recommend!”
